\chapter{Well-formedness Algorithm}
\label{chapter:wf-algorithm}

In this chapter,
we present the well-formedness algorithm
implemented in \lpeg{}
and prove its correctness.
We begin by introducing the signature
of the function \textit{\verifygrammarname{}},
which implements the well-formedness algorithm in Coq:
it takes a grammar $g$ and a natural number $gas$ as parameters
and returns an optional Boolean value.
The parameter $gas$ is decremented on every recursive call,
in order to convince Coq that the function terminates for every input.
If this parameter ever reaches zero,
the function returns $\None$,
signaling it ran out of gas.
Otherwise, it returns $\Some b$,
where the Boolean value $b$
indicates whether the grammar
is well-formed or not.

We proved in Coq that,
for any input grammar $g$,
there exists a lower bound for the parameter $gas$
for which \textit{\verifygrammarname{}} returns $\Some b$.
We do not need to assume anything
about the grammar, because the function
performs all the necessary checks.
This works as a proof of termination
for the algorithm.
In practice, this results allows
\lpeg{} to implement this function in~C
without the gas parameter,
as it is not necessary.
\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:verifygrammar-termination}
    $\forall gas \ge \verifygrammargas{g}$,
    $\exists b\ \verifygrammarcomp{g}{gas} = \Some b$.
\end{lemma}

We define this lower bound
in \Cref{fig:verifygrammargas}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{verifygrammargas}
    \caption{The well-formedness function gas lower bound.}
    \label{fig:verifygrammargas}
\end{figure}
The function takes into account
$\length{g}$, the number of rules in the grammar,
and $\size{g}$, the size of the grammar.
We define the size of a pattern $p$, also denoted as $\size{p}$,
as the number of nodes in its abstract syntax tree,
and the size of a grammar $g$
as the summation of the sizes of its rules,
that is, $\sum_{r \in g} \size{r}$.
One neat property about grammar rules is
that they are always smaller than the grammar themselves,
as displayed in \Cref{lemma:size-of-r-le-size-of-g}.
This property follows from the definition of grammar sizes,
and from the fact that pattern sizes are non-negative.
\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:size-of-r-le-size-of-g}
    $\forall r \in g$, $\size{r} \le \size{g}$.
\end{lemma}

At this point,
it can be hard to explain the rationale behind this equation,
as we haven't discussed each step in-depth yet.
We will therefore leave the explanation for this lower bound
to \Cref{section:lr-rules},
when we introduce the left recursion check.

With this lower bound,
we can define the function \textit{wf},
which takes a grammar $g$ and returns a Boolean value
indicating whether $g$ is well-formed.
It basically calls \textit{\verifygrammarname{}}
with the gas lower bound.
If \textit{\verifygrammarname{}} returns $\Some b$,
then \textit{wf} returns $b$.
If, otherwise, \textit{\verifygrammarname{}} returns $\None$,
then \textit{wf} returns $true$.
This last case is irrelevant, because we know it cannot happen.
Nevertheless, we return $true$
to demonstrate that the function
and gas estimation are correct.
\Cref{fig:wf} displays the function \textit{wf}.

Let us now get into the function \textit{\verifygrammarname{}},
which is divided into four steps.
Each step is implemented by a different function.
The first two functions,
named \textit{\coherentname{}} and \textit{\lcoherentname{}},
do not receive a gas parameter,
as they are defined recursively on the structure of patterns
and lists of patterns, respectively.
This structural recursion is enough to convince Coq
that these functions terminate.
Meanwhile, the last two functions,
named \textit{\lverifyrulename{}} and \textit{\lcheckloopsname{}},
receive a gas parameter,
as their recursion goes beyond the structure of patterns,
and involves visiting arbitrary grammar rules.
Therefore, in order to prove that \textit{\verifygrammarname{}} terminates,
we need to provide lower bounds for the gas parameter of both
\textit{\lverifyrulename{}} and \textit{\lcheckloopsname{}}.

The implementation of these functions
will be discussed in the following sections.
For now, let us briefly go over them.
The first two steps are relatively simple,
while the third and fourth steps are more complex,
as they involve symbolically parsing each rule.

The first step of the algorithm is trivial.
It merely ensures the existence of
the first rule of the grammar,
given that it is used as the starting point
for parsing the grammar.

The second step is similar to the first one,
as it makes sure that every rule in the grammar
only references rules that exist in the grammar.
This ensures that we can safely
dereference any nonterminal patterns later on.
This step is an extended version of the previous one
for lists of patterns.

The third step
ensures that the grammar contains no
left-recursive rules.
It does so by symbolically executing the parsing routine
for each rule in the grammar
and checking whether it can reach the same rule twice
without consuming any input.

The fourth and final step
makes sure that the grammar contains
no degenerate loops,
which are repetitions of patterns
that may match while consuming no input.

If a grammar passes all these checks,
then it is considered well-formed.
In the following sections,
we go into each of these steps
in greater detail.
We also define equivalent inductive predicates
for each step and for the \textit{\verifygrammarname{}} function,
to aid us in the proofs.
We also prove these predicates
follow the corresponding fixed-point definitions.
