\chapter{Well-formedness Algorithm}
\label{chapter:wf-algorithm}

In this chapter,
we present the well-formedness algorithm
implemented in \lpeg{}
and prove its correctness.
We start with the overall structure
of the algorithm.
\Cref{fig:verifygrammar-function}
displays the function that implements the algorithm,
which can be seen as a sequence of four steps,
each of which we will get into later.
\begin{figure}

    \label{fig:verifygrammar-function}
\end{figure}
The function \textit{\verifygrammarname{}}
takes a grammar and some gas as parameters,
and returns an optional Boolean value.
The gas counter serves merely to convince Coq
that the function terminates for any input.
If this counter ever reaches zero,
the function returns $\None$.
Otherwise, it returns $\Some b$,
where the Boolean value $b$
indicates whether the grammar
is well-formed or not.

We prove that,
for any input grammar $g$,
there exists a lower bound for the gas counter
for which \textit{\verifygrammarname{}} returns $\Some b$.
We do not need to assume anything
about the grammar, because the function
performs all the necessary checks
in the correct order.
This works as a proof of termination
for the algorithm.
\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:verifygrammar-termination}
    $\forall gas \ge \verifygrammargas{g}$,
    $\exists b\ \verifygrammarcomp{g}{gas} = \Some b$.
\end{lemma}

We define this lower bound
in \Cref{fig:verifygrammargas}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{verifygrammargas}
    \caption{The well-formedness function gas lower bound.}
    \label{fig:verifygrammargas}
\end{figure}
The function takes into account
$\length{g}$, the number of rules in the grammar,
and $\size{g}$, the size of the grammar.
We define the size of a pattern $p$, also denoted as $\size{p}$,
as the number of nodes in its abstract syntax tree,
and the size of a grammar $g$
as the summation of the sizes of its rules,
that is, $\sum_{r \in g} \size{r}$.

With this lower bound,
we can define the function \textit{wf},
which takes a grammar $g$ and returns a Boolean value
indicating whether $g$ is well-formed.
\Cref{fig:wf} displays the implementation
of the function \textit{wf}.
It basically calls \textit{\verifygrammarname{}}
with $\verifygrammargas{g}$ as the gas counter.
If it returns $\Some b$, we simply return $b$.
Otherwise, we return $true$.
This default value is irrelevant,
because this case cannot happen.
Nevertheless, we return $true$
to demonstrate that the function
and gas estimation are correct.

Now that we have defined \textit{wf},
let us get into \textit{\verifygrammarname{}}.
In \Cref{fig:verifygrammar-function},
the reader may observe that
it calls four functions that we have not defined yet.
The first two functions,
\textit{\coherentname{}} and \textit{\lcoherentname{}},
do not use the gas counter,
because they operate recursively on the structure of patterns
and lists of patterns, respectively.
This type of structural recursion is enough for Coq
to determine that these functions terminate.
Meanwhile, the last two functions,
\textit{\lverifyrulename{}} and \textit{\lcheckloopsname{}},
need to visit rules recursively,
and are, therefore, defined recursively on a gas parameter.
Just like we did for
the \textit{\verifygrammarname{}} function,
we also prove that \textit{\lverifyrulename{}} and \textit{\lcheckloopsname{}}
terminate by providing a lower bound for the gas parameter.
(Without these proofs,
we would not be able to prove the termination
of \textit{\verifygrammarname{}}.)

Regarding the implementation of these functions,
we will get into each of them in the following sections.
For now, we will briefly explain what each of them does.
The first two steps are relatively simple,
while the third and fourth steps are more complex,
as they involve symbolically parsing each rule.

The first step of the algorithm is trivial.
It merely ensures that $\PNT{0}$,
the first rule of the grammar,
is defined,
given that it is used as the starting point
for parsing the grammar.
We implement this step with the function
\textit{\coherentname{}},
which takes a grammar $g$ and a pattern $p$
and returns a Boolean value
that indicates whether $p$ only references rules
that exist in $g$.

The second step is similar to the first one,
as it makes sure that every rule in the grammar
only references rules that exist in the grammar.
This ensures that we can safely
dereference any nonterminal patterns later on.
This step is implemented by the function \textit{\lcoherentname{}},
which is an extended version of \textit{\coherentname{}}
for lists of patterns.

The third step
ensures that the grammar contains no
left-recursive rules.
It does so by symbolically executing the parsing routine
for each rule in the grammar
and checking whether it can reach the same rule twice
without consuming any input.
This step is implemented by the function \textit{\lverifyrulename{}},
which takes a grammar $g$, a list of rules $rs$, and a gas counter
and returns an optional Boolean value
indicating whether all rules in the list $rs$
are not left-recursive.

The fourth and final step
looks for any degenerate loops,
which are repetitions of patterns
that may match while consuming no input.
This step is implemented by the function \textit{\lcheckloopsname{}},
and uses a simpler version
of the algorithm from the previous step.
It takes a grammar $g$, a list of rules $rs$, and a gas counter
and returns an optional Boolean value
indicating whether all rules in the list $rs$
are free of degenerate loops.

If a grammar passes all these checks,
then it is considered well-formed.
In the following sections,
we go into each of these steps
in greater detail.
We also define equivalent inductive predicates
for each step and for the \textit{\verifygrammarname{}} function,
to aid us in the proofs.
We also prove these predicates
follow the corresponding fixed-point definitions.
